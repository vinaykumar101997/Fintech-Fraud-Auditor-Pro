# Evaluation

This page explains how the numbers in the README are measured, what they do and don't show, and how the benchmark has changed.

## How the numbers are measured

All numbers come from `data/sample_ledger_labelled.csv`: 465 transactions, 45 of them labelled as laundering across six patterns. The file is generated, not checked in:

```bash
python scripts/generate_sample_ledger.py   # fixed seed (7), byte-identical on every machine
python scripts/evaluate.py                 # prints both pipelines side by side
```

| Pipeline | Recall | Precision | F1 | Forwarded to the AI tier |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Original ordering | 7% | 33% | 0.11 | 9 rows (2%) |
| Current ordering | 84% | 79% | 0.82 | 48 rows (10%) |

Recall is the share of laundering rows forwarded for review instead of being dropped. It matters most here, because a dropped row is never looked at again.

## What catches each pattern

| Pattern | Rows | Recall (current) | Recall (original) | Caught by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| structuring | 10 | 100% | 0% | Rule: structuring band |
| sanctioned | 6 | 100% | 0% | Rule: high-risk jurisdiction |
| fan_in | 11 | 100% | 0% | Behaviour model, no rule reaches it |
| circular | 3 | 100% | 100% | Rule: amount of $10,000 or more |
| circular_small | 7 | 100% | 0% | Behaviour model, because the accounts are new |
| circular_camouflaged | 8 | 12% (1/8) | 0% | Coincidence, see below |

**Why the original ordering failed.** The first version ran an IsolationForest on transaction amount before any rule. Structuring is defined by amounts that look ordinary, so the model dropped it, and a $500 transfer from a sanctioned country never reached the country check. Running rules first, with a review flag the model can't override, fixed it.

**`circular_small` is caught because its accounts are new.** Its accounts each transact once in the whole batch, so the behaviour model flags them as unusual. No feature encodes "this is a cycle". The same amounts routed through accounts with ordinary history would not be caught this way.

**`circular_camouflaged` tests exactly that.** It is the same ring shape, built from businesses that already trade normally in the background, spread over about ten days. One of eight rows is forwarded, and only because its amount ($9,210.86) happened to fall in the structuring band. The other seven are missed.

## The CI gate

CI runs:

```bash
python scripts/evaluate.py --min-recall 1.0 --min-pattern-recall 1.0 --gate-exclude circular_camouflaged
```

The build fails if recall on any gated pattern drops below 100%. `circular_camouflaged` is excluded because failing every build on a known, unfixed gap teaches people to ignore red builds. It is still printed in every report, so the gap stays visible.

The pytest suite and the evaluation gate catch different problems. The rule tests fail when a rule breaks even if the behaviour model happens to compensate. The evaluation gate fails when the behaviour model degrades even if every rule test still passes.

## Limits of this benchmark

The same author wrote the features the model looks at (`utils/features.py`), the rule thresholds (`utils/rules.py`) and the patterns injected into the test data (`scripts/generate_sample_ledger.py`). A 100% recall shows the pipeline catches what it was built to catch, on data shaped by the same assumptions. It is not evidence that it generalises to unseen patterns, adversarial ledgers or real production data. Treat the gated numbers as a guard against reintroducing the original bug, not as a real-world detection rate.

## Benchmark change: `circular_small` amounts

The generator used to draw each `circular_small` leg independently between $3,000 and $7,000, so a ring could grow 57% in one lap. Real round-tripped money doesn't do that, so each hop now forwards 90 to 100% of the previous leg. The seed and the number of random draws are unchanged, so only 5 rows changed and every other pattern is byte-identical.

Behaviour-model recall is unchanged for every pattern:

| Pattern | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| structuring | 10/10 | 10/10 |
| sanctioned | 6/6 | 6/6 |
| fan_in | 11/11 | 11/11 |
| circular | 3/3 | 3/3 |
| circular_small | 7/7 | 7/7 |
| circular_camouflaged | 1/8 | 1/8 |
| clean (false positives) | 10/420 | 10/420 |

## Network check: circular-flow findings

These numbers come from auditing every row against the full ledger with the network check. They were measured with a one-off analysis; a script that reproduces them is on the roadmap.

| Pattern | Shape only, old data | Fund flow, old data | Fund flow, new data |
|---|---|---|---|
| clean (false positives) | 420/420 | 25/420 | 25/420 |
| circular | 3/3 | 3/3 | 3/3 |
| circular_small | 7/7 | 0/7 | 7/7 |
| circular_camouflaged | 8/8 | 0/8 | 0/8 |

Shape-only detection flagged every clean row, because businesses that trade in both directions form graph cycles all the time. Fund-flow detection only counts a cycle when the transfers run forward in time, finish within the window and keep similar amounts.

- `circular_small` drops to 0/7 on the old data only because its old legs failed the amount tolerance.
- The remaining 25 clean rows are coincidences in the random background: 11 two-way pairs and one three-account ring, where opposite trades of similar size happened to land within a day. Nothing in the data separates them from a real quick round trip.
- `circular_camouflaged` is 0/8: its legs are about two days apart with unrelated amounts, so under these rules it is not a fund-flow ring. Nothing was tuned to raise it.

The 1-day window and 20% tolerance were chosen on this synthetic data and still need validating on the IBM AML dataset.
